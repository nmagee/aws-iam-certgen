aws-iam-certgen
===============

A simple bash script that will generate an x.509 key and certificate for you. This allows you to securely use the various AWS API tools [http://aws.amazon.com/developertools]. 

System Requirements
===================
- You will need a fairly current version of BASH on your system.
- OpenSSL is required.

This was written in MacOSX (10.8.3) but works just fine in Ubuntu, Debian, and RedHhat.
